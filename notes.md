## Robust Evaluation Matrix

Doroudi et al.
A/B testing?
Instructional policy : flowchart

Calibrate a best policy for one student model
=> Might not be good for other models
! Not try to be good everywhere, otherwise overfitting

## Visual approach

Design space unlimited
Solution space underdefined

Compromise between top-down expert et bottom-up data-driven

Their tool, **tempr** is [on GitHub](https://github.com/fratamico/Tempr---A-visual-knowledge-engineering-tool).

Allows to merge actions and see the amount of these buckets of actions in the logs over time (for high learners and low learners), potentially to verify theories.

Tested on a complex interface for learning electrical engineering:

## Next Step Recommendation

Navigational efficiency: jump directly to resource

Use LSTMs (certain type of recurrent neural networks) to model the behavior of a student given their history, and predict the next page on which they will spent more time (in order to recommend it to them).

Do not only train on certified students, in order to get more data.

- Baseline (next lesson): 52%
- n-gram: 61%
- LSTM: 64%

They had to log the visited pages via JavaScript.

### Questions

- Why not recommend several pages?
- Indeed we should, more relevant course, more relevant discussion post, etc.
- For adults: several choices is better, for kids: one choice is better.

- You did collaborative filtering, why not content-based?
- We should try, yes.

- Why LSTM, not other approaches?
- Not matrix factorization because there is a high temporal component (but we could do tensor factorization, right).

- What if it hurts? Because you're not optimizing anything.
- Maybe yes.

## Learning to program with localization

Are learning outcomes associated with the presence or absence of localization in educational software?

Did users of Scratch learned programming better if the blocks were in their language?

TL;DR: No.

### Statistics

- 20.8M projects shared
- 17M users
- 107M comments
- 3M studios created

See also [scratch.mit.edu/statistics](https://scratch.mit.edu/statistics)

Study done on Portugal, Italy, Brazil, Germany, Norway.

They discovered: for 80% of the users, language does not change.

Measure of learning: block repertoire (~ vocabulary).

Main advantage: localization may save users that might not learn code at all.

## Teaching Students to Recognize and Implement Good Coding Style

They built AutoStyle, a tutor that automatically generates hints and feedback regarding the style of Python code.

Goal: Optimize readability of the reviewers.

Goal of the research: see if multiple-choice questions / hints can help acquire good style.

- Use of built-in functions
- Avoid unnecessary control structures

Metrics: ABC Score (Assignment, Branch, Conditional)

- We want to avoid that students code in FORTRAN. At least they should learn some idioms. The question is: Is that medium skill learnable?
